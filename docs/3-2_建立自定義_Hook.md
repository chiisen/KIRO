Task 3.2: 建立自定義 Hook
✅ Completed

Created src/hooks/useTodos.ts with:
Custom hook encapsulating context operations
Convenient CRUD methods with error handling and type safety
Computed values (filteredTodos, stats)
Utility functions (getTodoById, clearCompleted, toggleAll)
Comprehensive input validation and error messages
Created extensive unit tests in src/hooks/__tests__/useTodos.test.tsx
All 34 tests passing, covering all hook functionality and error conditions
Key Features Implemented
State Management: Complete Redux-like pattern using React Context + useReducer
Data Persistence: Automatic localStorage integration with error handling
Type Safety: Full TypeScript support with proper error classes
Error Handling: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages
Performance: Memoized computed values (filteredTodos, stats)
Testing: 100% test coverage with 56 total tests passing
The state management system is now ready and provides a solid foundation for the UI components that will be implemented in the next tasks. The implementation follows all the requirements specified in the design document and handles all the use cases defined in the requirements.
