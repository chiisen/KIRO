I'll implement the first task from the todo-list spec. Let me start by updating the task status and then implementing the project structure and core type definitions.

Task: 1. 建立專案結構和核心類型定義 from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Now let me check the current project structure and then set up the React + TypeScript + Vite project.

Searched workspace
Check current project structure before setting up the React project
I'll create a React + TypeScript + Vite project structure. First, let me initialize the project with the necessary configuration files:

Created

package.json


Created

vite.config.ts


Created

tsconfig.json


Created

tsconfig.node.json


Now let me create the directory structure as specified in the design document:

Created

index.ts


Created

index.ts


Created

index.ts


Created

index.ts


Created

index.ts


Created

index.ts


Now let me create the core TypeScript type definitions as specified in the design document:

Created

todo.ts


Now let me create the remaining directory structure and placeholder files:

Created

TodoContext.tsx


Created

useTodos.ts


Created

storage.ts


Created

index.css


Now let me create the main entry point files:

Created

main.tsx


Created

index.html


Let me also create a Jest configuration file for testing:

Created

jest.config.js


Created

setupTests.ts


Now let me verify the project structure by listing the directories:

Searched workspace
Verify the complete project structure has been created
Perfect! Let me also verify that the TypeScript types are properly defined by checking the content:

Read file(s)

todo.ts
Now let me test that the TypeScript configuration is working by running a type check:

Command
npx tsc --noEmit
pm exec tsc --noEmit
Great! The TypeScript compilation passes without errors. Now let me update the task status to completed:

Task: 1. 建立專案結構和核心類型定義 from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task Completed Successfully! ✅
I've successfully implemented the first task "建立專案結構和核心類型定義" with the following accomplishments:

✅ React + TypeScript + Vite Project Structure
Created package.json with all necessary dependencies for React 18, TypeScript, Vite, and testing
Set up vite.config.ts for the build system
Configured TypeScript with tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json
Created index.html as the entry point
✅ Directory Structure
Created the complete directory structure as specified in the design document:

src/
├── components/          # React components (TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoForm, TodoFilter, TodoStats)
├── context/            # React Context (TodoContext.tsx)
├── hooks/              # Custom Hooks (useTodos.ts)
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions (todo.ts)
├── utils/              # Utility functions (storage.ts)
└── styles/             # Style files (index.css)
✅ Core TypeScript Type Definitions
Defined all core interfaces and types in src/types/todo.ts:

Todo interface with id, title, completed, createdAt, updatedAt
FilterType for 'all' | 'active' | 'completed'
TodoState interface for application state
TodoAction union type for all state management actions
TodoStats interface for statistics display
✅ Testing Setup
Configured Jest with jest.config.js
Set up React Testing Library with setupTests.ts
Ready for unit and integration testing
✅ Requirements Verification
This implementation satisfies the specified requirements:

需求 1.1: Project structure supports adding new todos
需求 2.1: Structure supports displaying todo lists
需求 3.1: Types support toggling completion status
The project is now ready for the next task in the implementation plan. All TypeScript types compile successfully and the foundation is set for building the todo list application.
